# Embedded Systems Projects, Tech Graylogix, Mangalore Internship  
### During my internship at Tech Graylogix in Mangalore, I worked on hands-on embedded systems projects using the Arduino UNO platform. These projects focused on real-world automation and control systems, combining hardware interfacing with programming to solve practical problems.  


## Projects Undertaken:  
### 1. Smart Irrigation System  
### Objective: Automate the watering process based on soil moisture levels to conserve water and reduce manual effort.  

### Key Features:  
### 
- Used a soil moisture sensor to detect real-time water levels in the soil.  
- Controlled a water pump with a relay module based on sensor input.  
- System provides autonomous irrigation, ideal for agricultural and home garden applications.  
- Built using Arduino UNO, with code written in embedded C using the Arduino IDE.


### 2. Voice-Controlled Robot  
### Objective: Design a robot that responds to voice commands for movement, such as forward, reverse, left, and right. 

### Key Features:
###
- Integrated a voice recognition module to detect and interpret user commands.  
- Controlled robot movement with DC motors driven by a motor driver.




## Tools & Skills Used:  
### Microcontroller: Arduino UNO  

### Sensors & Modules: Soil moisture sensor, voice recognition module, motor driver, relay  

### Programming: Embedded C, Arduino libraries  

### Development Platform: Arduino IDE  

### Core Concepts: Sensor interfacing, actuator control, digital I/O, signal processing, automation logic
